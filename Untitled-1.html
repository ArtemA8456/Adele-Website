        <h3>A bit about her biography</h3>
        <p>Adele was born on 25th October 2023, in a town named Lincoln. She lived with her mum, and her other 3 siblings(I think it was 3, I didn't see any other ones) and did so for pretty much the first 1.5 months of her life. When we came along she was a wee little kitten, and she still is! The moment me and mum saw her we knew which one we were going for! Out of the 4 kittens that were there, she was by far the most colourful one, she had shades of grey, white and black! We immediately told the owner to put her on hold so we can decide, but there wasn't much to be decided! I honestly think mum was dragging time before everyone was 100% sure they wanted a cat -_-. Finally on 13th December 2023 we adopted her and she became my first and favourite little kitten!</p>
