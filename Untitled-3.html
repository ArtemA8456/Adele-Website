            <h1>Adele's favourite treats!</h1>
        </div>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">Adele is a very sensitive kitten, especially her tummy! She can only eat certain foods or she'll get unwell, but even then she might still get sick if she eats too much. She loves most meat meals, which she finished in no time. Here are some of her favs:</p>
       <h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Petite Delights
              <p class="unhighlighted" style="font-size: 20px">Petite delights are one of Adele's favourite treats. Once we left her 2 packets because we were going camping, and she ate all of it almost instantly. So she REALLY like them</p>
            </li>
            <li>Chicken
                <p class="unhighlighted" style="font-size: 20px">This is a surprising one, we all thought that Adele, like all other cats would only eat catfood, but surprisingly she started really enjoying chicken, although only in small well cut out portions, otherwise she could get unwell</p>
            </li>
            <li>Butter and Sour Cream
                <p class="unhighlighted" style="font-size: 20px">This is probably the most interesting one of them all. Now she doesn't just eat butter, like she would eat chicken or anything else, instead, if she's lucky enough to find some butter lying around, on a toast, in the kitchen etc. she will make sure to at least take a couple licks at it. Similar to butter is sour cream, if she catches it lying around, from a meal we had or anything else, she will most definitely take some licks at it</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
